# AI Powered Home Hospital Scheduling System — Frontend (Vite + React)

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold for the Thesis project landing page.

What I created
- Clean, minimal project structure inside this folder.
- Landing page that displays: "AI Powerd Home Hospital Scheduling system" (note: spelling preserved from request).
- `.env.example` with placeholders for Supabase keys (we'll wire Supabase when you provide credentials).

Files of interest
- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry
- `src/App.jsx` — landing page
- `src/index.css` — small styles
- `package.json` — scripts and dependency pointers
- `.env.example` — supabase readiness

How to run locally
1. From this folder, install dependencies:

```powershell
cd AI-powered-Home-Hospital-Scheduling-System-FrontEnd
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

This will open the Vite dev server; visit the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Next steps I can take
- Add Supabase client wiring (when you provide project URL and anon key).
- Add routing, auth pages, and basic UI components.
- Move to TypeScript if you'd like stronger typing.
